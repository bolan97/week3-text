                <p>In this project I extracted information from the Wikipedia article gay by combining the data scraping method mentioned in the lab. I continued to sift through the jumble of information I needed - extracting the links from all the pages.</p>

                <p>So I got all the links to the site. In the next step I tried to filter for keywords. I filtered out all the links that started with "http", so I got a lot more compact Wikipedia subsites.</p>

                <p>In this attempt I learnt how to get more specific information on the internet in further detail. This is an efficient way to get information. Web scraping allows us to collect structured data. Structured data is simply a way of representing information that can be easily read by a computer or added to a database. The computer does not have to rely on humans to read or process web pages. When I imagine that if I give the computer the right instructions for crawling, the computer can do it in less than a second. It can also do it repeatedly and tirelessly at any scale.</p>
